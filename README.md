## Description 

For this project I worked in SQL and Node.JS to create a company database and interface. Ising the EmployeeTracker app, the user can view and create new employees, roles, and managers, as well as delete employees and update roles.

## Key Features
* MYSQL database management
* Fully command line driven 
* Easy and intuative prompting using inquire
* Comands Available:
    * VIEW EMPLOYEE
    * VIEW ROLE
    * VIEW DEPARTMENT
    * ADD EMPLOYEE
    * ADD ROLE
    * ADD DEPARTMENT
    * UPDATE EMPLOYEE ROLE
    * DELETE EMPLOYEE
    * EXIT

## Installation
Download files from [this github repo](https://github.com/cgsdesign/EmployeeTracker). Then, in your command line, log into mysql, and run the schema and seeds files. Add an .env file with your mysql password for ease of use. Then, in the terminal type node index.js. The file will automatically run.
